At the beginning of 2014 I've started working on this project, my aim was to controll a rc toy with a raspberry pi. 
Which vehicel would be more interesting than a tank? That's why I bought a used one and started soldering and coding.

This set of file allows you to create your own Tank based on a raspberry pi.

	-the cannon can be shoot

Whatch your drive throught the live-stream.
